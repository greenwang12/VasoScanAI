#VasoScanAI 


---

## Project Overview
VasoScan is an AI-powered **decision-support system** that analyzes fingertip videos using  
**video-based photoplethysmography (vPPG)** to derive physiological indicators related to  
micro blood flow and peripheral circulation quality.

The system is developed **strictly for academic and research purposes** and does **not**
provide medical diagnosis or clinical measurements.

---

## Objectives
- Extract vPPG signals from fingertip video recordings
- Compute meaningful physiological **indicators and indices**
- Estimate a **circulation risk score** using machine learning
- Visualize **longitudinal health trends** across multiple scans
- Provide **decision-support insights** and precautionary suggestions

---

## System Outputs (Safe & Strong Claims)
The system generates the following **non-diagnostic outputs**:

- Heart Rate **Indicator**
- Blood Flow Quality **Index**
- Circulation **Risk Score** (Machine Learning–based)
- Stress / Low-Perfusion **Indicator**
- Decision-Support **Precautionary Insights**
- Time-Series **Health Trend Visualizations**

> All outputs are expressed as **indicators, proxies, indices, or risk scores**,  
> and are **not clinical diagnoses**.

---

## What the System Does NOT Provide
- Medical diagnosis
- SpO₂ measurement
- Clinical stress score
- Disease confirmation or prediction

This limitation is intentional to ensure **ethical, academic, and legal safety**.

## Privacy & Security
- Uploaded videos are processed temporarily and removed after analysis
- No biometric images are permanently stored
- Default avatars are used instead of real profile photos
- Sensitive data and credentials are excluded using `.gitignore`

## Academic Relevance
This project demonstrates practical application of:
- Signal processing techniques
- Machine learning in healthcare-related contexts
- Ethical AI system design
- Backend system architecture
- Data-driven decision-support systems

---

## Conclusion
VasoScan illustrates how **AI and computer vision** can be responsibly applied  
to derive meaningful **physiological indicators** while maintaining strong  
ethical boundaries, data privacy, and academic integrity.
